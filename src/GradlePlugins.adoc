== gradle-plugin-scr

== !Purpose

Adds the `processScrAnnotations` task to processes the @SCR annotations and
create the appropriate OSGi metadata for OSGi Declarative Services

== gradle-plugin-cq-bundle

== !Tasks

[.em07]

[horizontal]
uploadBundle::
  Uploads the bundle to the CQ server. The task will fail if the bundle fails to start.

startBundle::
  Start the bundle on the servers. This task will fail if the bundle does
  not exist on the server.

stopBundle::
  Stop the bundle on the servers. This task will **_not_** fail if the bundle
  does not exist on the server.

removeBundle::
  Uninstalls and deletes the bundle on the servers. This task will **_not_**
  fail if the bundle does not exist on the server.

refreshAllBundles::
  Tells CQ to refresh all the bundles. This gets added to the top-level
  project and generally a good idea to run after any of the other tasks.

[horizontal]
createPackage::
  This will create vault package, adding special features to make it easier
  to work with for the specifics that CQ wants.

uploadPackage::
  Upload the package to all the servers defined by the `slingServers`
  configuration. If the package already exists (even as a "-SNAPSHOT"), you probably want to uninstall and remove it before uploading a new one. See
http://blog.mooregreatsoftware.com/2015/07/21/aem-6-dot-1-packages-and-bundles-installing-and-uninstalling-behavior/[AEM 6.1 Packages and Bundles - Installing and Uninstalling Behavior]
for much more information on why. For that reason it depends on `removePackage` by default.

[.em07]
--
[horizontal]
installPackage::
  Installs the CQ Package that has been uploaded.

uninstallPackage::
  Uninstalls the CQ Package. **If the package is not on the server, nothing happens.**
  (i.e., This does not fail if the package is not on the server.)

removePackage::
  Removes the package from CQ. **Does not fail if the package was not on the
  server to begin with.** This depends on `uninstallPackage` so that the old
  content is not left behind.

== !Tasks for Bundles In Packages

[.em07]
--
[horizontal]
validateBundles::
  Checks all the JARs that are included in this package to make sure they
  are installed and in an ACTIVE state. Gives a report of any that are not.
  This task polls using the server settings for retries and max time in the
  case the bundles are newly installed.

validateRemoteBundles::
  The same as validateBundles but downloads the package as it exists on
  the remote server, then extracts it to get the bundles inside it.

uninstallBundles::
  Downloads the currently installed package .zip file if it exists, compiles
  a list of bundles based off what is currently installed, then stops and
  uninstalls each bundles individually.
--

== !Support Tasks

[.em08]

[horizontal]
addBundlesToFilterXml::
  Adds the bundles to the filter.xml

verifyBundles::
  Checks all the JARs that are included in this package to make sure they
  are OSGi compliant, and gives a report of any that are not.
  Never causes the build to fail.

startInactiveBundles::
  Asynchronously attempts to start any bundle in a RESOLVED state.

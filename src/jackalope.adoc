Using Groovy’s properties support to get rid of some noise

Extremely easy to physically see the structure/hierarchy. Could have done n(“/content/test1/callingrates/intl-direct-dial”), but broke it apart to make the hierarchy obvious.

```groovy
import static com.twcable.jackalope.JCRBuilder.node
 import static com.twcable.jackalope.JCRQueryBuilder.query
 import static com.twcable.jackalope.JCRQueryBuilder.result

  given:
 def node = node("result").build()
 def session = node.session  

JCRQueryBuilder.queryManager(session,
                             query("SELECT ...",
                                   JCR_SQL2, result(node))
).build()

 when:
 def queryResult = session.workspace.queryManager.
                    createQuery("SELECT ...", JCR_SQL2).execute() 

 then:
 queryResult.nodes.first() == node
```

A Session is automatically created for the Node, and the Session is implicitly part of a Workspace

The QueryManager is "`attached`" to the Session that gets created for the Node

== Primary Jackalope Alternatives

* https://github.com/Citytechinc/prosper[CITYTECH's Prosper]
** Very Groovy and dynamic DSL

* https://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/jcr-mock.html[Sling JCR Mocks]
** Essentially the "`normal`" API
** Verbose and does not "`show`" the structure
